Trying to figure this out!

Hi everyone!
I am just a simple person trying to learn how to code. I am close to the NYC area. So far just working on my HTML and CSS skills with a bit of bootstrap mixed in. Next on my to-learn list will be javascript(yikes!). I've got a website in the works. Other projects will be coming soon!
See you guys later!
